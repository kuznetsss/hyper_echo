Hyper_echo is an echo server empowered by [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/), [tower](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/), [hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/index.html) and [fastwebsockets](https://docs.rs/fastwebsockets/latest/fastwebsockets/index.html).
It supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols, making it ideal for testing and debugging network applications.

## üí°Features
### Http:
- Echoes back any the received request (except websocket upgrade)
- Customizable logging levels:
  - `0`: No logging (default)
  - `1`: Log the request URI
  - `2`: Log the request URI and headers
  - `3`: Log the request URI, headers, and body

### WebSocket:
- Echoes received message back to the client
- Logging of received messages (off by default)
- Sends periodic pings (every 5 seconds by default) to keep connections alive and disconnects inactive clients

### Other
- Colorful log output when the output is a terminal
- Choose your desired port or let `hyper_echo` automatically find a free one
- Supports multi-threading, but is optimized for single-threaded use by default.

Use the flag `--help` to discover CLI options for customizing the behavior of `hyper_echo`.
